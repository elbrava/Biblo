
                        I looked again, and this time I saw a scroll flying through the air.
                    

                        The angel asked me what I saw. I answered, "A scroll flying through the air; it is thirty feet long and fifteen feet wide."
                    

                        Then he said to me, "On it is written the curse that is to go out over the whole land. On one side of the scroll it says that every thief will be removed from the land; and on the other side it says that everyone who tells lies under oath will also be taken away.
                    

                        The Lord Almighty says that he will send this curse out, and it will enter the house of every thief and the house of everyone who tells lies under oath. It will remain in their houses and leave them in ruins."
                    

                        The angel appeared again and said, "Look! Something else is coming!"
                    

                        "What is it?" I asked. He replied, "It is a basket, and it stands for the sin  of the whole land."
                    

                        The basket had a lid made of lead. As I watched, the lid was raised, and there in the basket sat a woman!
                    

                        The angel said, "This represents wickedness." Then he pushed her down into the basket and put the lid back down.
                    

                        I looked up and saw two women flying toward me with powerful wings like those of a stork. They picked up the basket and flew off with it.
                    

                        I asked the angel, "Where are they taking it?"
                    

                        He answered, "To Babylonia, where they will build a temple for it. When the temple is finished, the basket will be placed there to be worshiped."
