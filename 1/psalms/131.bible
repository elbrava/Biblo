
                        Lord, I have given up my pride and turned away from my arrogance. I am not concerned with great matters or with subjects too difficult for me.
                    

                        Instead, I am content and at peace. As a child lies quietly in its mother's arms, so my heart is quiet within me.
                    

                        Israel, trust in the Lord now and forever!
