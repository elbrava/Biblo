                        Evil people listen to evil ideas, and liars listen to lies.
                    

                        If you make fun of poor people, you insult the God who made them. You will be punished if you take pleasure in someone's misfortune.
                    

                        Grandparents are proud of their grandchildren, just as children are proud of their parents.

                        If you want people to like you, forgive them when they wrong you. Remembering wrongs can break up a friendship.
                    

                        An intelligent person learns more from one rebuke than a fool learns from being beaten a hundred times.

                        It is better to meet a mother bear robbed of her cubs than to meet some fool busy with a stupid project.
                    

                        If you repay good with evil, you will never get evil out of your house.
                    

                        The start of an argument is like the first break in a dam; stop it before it goes any further.
                    

                        Condemning the innocent or letting the wicked go - both are hateful to the Lord.

                        Friends always show their love. What are relatives for if not to share trouble? 1


                        Only someone with no sense would promise to be responsible for someone else's debts.
                    

                        To like sin is to like making trouble. If you brag all the time,  you are asking for trouble.
                    

                        Anyone who thinks and speaks evil can expect to find nothing good - only disaster.
                    

                        There is nothing but sadness and sorrow for parents whose children do foolish things.
                    

                        Being cheerful keeps you healthy. It is slow death to be gloomy all the time.
                    

                        Corrupt judges accept secret bribes, and then justice is not done.

                        After all, even fools may be thought wise and intelligent if they stay quiet and keep their mouths shut. 2
