                        Listen when I reprimand you; I will give you good advice and share my knowledge with you.
                    

                        I have been calling you, inviting you to come, but you would not listen. You paid no attention to me.
                    

                        You have ignored all my advice and have not been willing to let me correct you.

                        Then you will call for wisdom, but I will not answer. You may look for me everywhere, but you will not find me.
                    

                        You have never had any use for knowledge and have always refused to obey the Lord.
                    

                        You have never wanted my advice or paid any attention when I corrected you.
