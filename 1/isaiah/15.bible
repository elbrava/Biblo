                        The people of Dibon  climb the hill to weep at the shrine. The people of Moab wail in grief over the cities of Nebo and Medeba; they have shaved their heads and their beards in grief.
                    

                        The people in the streets are dressed in sackcloth; in the city squares and on the rooftops people mourn and cry.
                    

                        The people of Heshbon and Elealeh cry out, and their cry can be heard as far away as Jahaz. Even the soldiers tremble; their courage is gone.
                    

                        My heart cries out for Moab! The people have fled to the town of Zoar, and to Eglath Shelishiyah. Some climb the road to Luhith, weeping as they go; some escape to Horonaim, grieving loudly.
                    

                        Nimrim Brook is dry, the grass beside it has withered, and nothing green is left.
                    

                        The people go across the Valley of Willows, trying to escape with all their possessions.
                    

                        Everywhere at Moab's borders the sound of crying is heard. It is heard at the towns of Eglaim and Beerelim.
                    

                        At the town of Dibon the river is red with blood, and God has something even worse in store for the people there. Yes, there will be a bloody slaughter of everyone left in Moab.
