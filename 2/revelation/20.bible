
                        Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding in his hand the key of the abyss and a heavy chain.
                    

                        He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent - that is, the Devil, or Satan - and chained him up for a thousand years. 1


                        The angel threw him into the abyss, locked it, and sealed it, so that he could not deceive the nations any more until the thousand years were over. After that he must be set loose for a little while.
                    

                        Then I saw thrones, and those who sat on them were given the power to judge. I also saw the souls of those who had been executed because they had proclaimed the truth that Jesus revealed and the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or its image, nor had they received the mark of the beast on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and ruled as kings with Christ for a thousand years. 2


                        (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were over.) This is the first raising of the dead.
                    

                        Happy and greatly blessed are those who are included in this first raising of the dead. The second death has no power over them; they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and they will rule with him for a thousand years.
                    

                        After the thousand years are over, Satan will be set loose from his prison,
                    

                        and he will go out to deceive the nations scattered over the whole world, that is, Gog and Magog. Satan will bring them all together for battle, as many as the grains of sand on the seashore. 3


                        They spread out over the earth and surrounded the camp of God's people and the city that he loves. But fire came down from heaven and destroyed them.
                    

                        Then the Devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had already been thrown; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.
                    

                        Then I saw a great white throne and the one who sits on it. Earth and heaven fled from his presence and were seen no more. 4


                        And I saw the dead, great and small alike, standing before the throne. Books were opened, and then another book was opened, the book of the living. The dead were judged according to what they had done, as recorded in the books. 5


                        Then the sea gave up its dead. Death and the world of the dead also gave up the dead they held. And all were judged according to what they had done.
                    

                        Then death and the world of the dead were thrown into the lake of fire. (This lake of fire is the second death.)
                    

                        Those who did not have their name written in the book of the living were thrown into the lake of fire.
